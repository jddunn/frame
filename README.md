# Lookback

Lookback will be a notetaking / journaling web and desktop application with natural language processing features, built with Electron, React, and Python.

Designed for introspective and analytical users, the UI links texts to AllenNLP's Predictor API (running in the Python backend), so that a user can ask a question in the app and see the answer in context of his / her selected notes (machine comprehenseion). 

Because a Python environment running TensorFlow is required to use the app offline, Lookback's journaling features are available without NLP. And eventually, a donation-supported / paid edition could be serviced for online users through a server on the cloud.
